# BG-Scoresheets

A simple web application for scoring boardgame plays.

## üìñ General info

A bunch of boardgames, that involve somewhat complicated scoring, come with paper scoresheets aimed at simplifying the scoring process.
At the same time the game itself usually doesn't involve any "pen and paper" routine, so the scoring process becomes a separate activity.
And those scoresheets while sharing common layout are unique for each game due to unique scoring categories and varying number of possible players.

The idea behind this app was to develop a simple digital resource, which would provide some additional quality of life features alongside removing the necessity of using pen and paper.

While trying to keep it simple and focusing on replacing paper scoresheets with their digital analogue, the app also allows to save game session results and player info, creating custom scoresheets, as well as
provides integration with [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/), the most popular and complete boardgame web resource out there.

## üìù Features

This app currently has following features:

- Boardgame scoring interface
- Built-in scoresheets for several popular boardgames
- Custom scoresheet creating interface
- Saving game session results
